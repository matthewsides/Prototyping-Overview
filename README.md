# Prototyping

## Introduction 

This report explores forms of prototypes appropriate for various functionality and end user testing requirements. Further delving into the history, purpose, uses, characteristics, etc. of prototyping/prototypes, the forms of prototypes and end user testing requirements. 

 

### What is prototyping? 

Prototyping refers to the process of developing upon an established idea or as termed ‘prototype’, which is used as an early representation of part or all of an interactive system.  Essentially a prototype is a tangible model I.e. an early example in which a new working product can be derived.   

### How prototypes are produced? 

Prototypes are produced through researching and clarifying the requirements/design elements (Scope/Brainstorming), developing an initial prototype based upon the information gathered and thoughts collated during the previous phase.  Thereafter carrying out tests to discern the issues with the current prototype and areas of improvement, which is then evaluated and reviewed to ascertain what could have been done better and the next steps required to ensure the system meets a certain level of standard pertaining to the requirements.  This process may continue depending on whether the product or system has been properly fleshed out and attained the standard expected.

### Prototypes in Software Development 

Prototypes in relation to Software development refers to developing software application prototypes which display the functionality of the system under development but may not actually hold the exact logic of the final software.  

Software Prototyping enables an early understanding of user requirements at an early stage of development, including certain requirements not considered during the product design. The application of prototypes in software development also allows developers to form a framework or foundation for their ideas and the logic of the system, building upon these key elements.  

### What is a Prototype? 

“A prototype is an early conceptual sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.” 

The goal of a prototype is to evaluate an idea. 

David Walker, Ph.D.; Executor Director of the Learning Technologies at McMaster University, states; "subsequent models are created by refining earlier versions, with the aim of convergence on the desired end product. 

This design methodology is sometimes known as evolutionary design or incremental development. Different versions of prototyping are used in software design, system development, and electronics engineering." 

### History of Prototyping  

The ideological values behind prototyping were conceived and have been applied since the dawn of civilization, particularly in human architecture and engineering however it wasn’t until the 1960’s that prototyping was formally acknowledged as a useful technique.  

The Prototyping timeline with regards to software engineering or development is relatively short, though has sought the introduction of the waterfall lifecycle in the 1970’s (Winston Royce), While in the 1980’s the first basic prototypes were formulated and seen in the form of flowcharts. 

 Following the formulation of basic prototypes saw the integration of paper prototyping for usability testing in 1985, enabling developers to garner an idea and flesh out the in workings of a system before development and release to better grasp the functionality and improve upon the system (to meet specified requirements). 

Microsoft PowerPoint was released in 1987, a common tool used for creating rough wireframes. A Wireframe is essentially another form of prototype based on the user interface (UI) of a piece of software (I.E. a basic skeleton of the layout). 

Whilst in 1988 Boehm founded the Spiral Model, derived from iterative development process model’s and sequential linear development model ‘s. The spiral model has four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation. Each subsequent spiral build on the baseline spiral. This essentially means that after one cycle has passed another is started and built upon the previous. 

In the 1990’s another tool used for wireframing and used by user experience designers was released by Adobe, known as Photoshop. A year later in 1991 IBM introduced RAD (Rapid Application Development) software development, an agile methodology which heavily emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative delivery, a sharp alternative to the waterfall development model, which focuses largely on planning and sequential design practices. 

Ensuing IBM’s introduction to RAD saw the release of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which describe the four core values of agile software development; individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation; customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and responding to change over following a plan. 

The subsequent years saw the rise of Web-based (SaaS) prototyping (2005) and the Lean UX movement conceived (2008), Inspired by Lean and Agile development theories. Lean UX is a user-centric approach that focuses on reducing the waste produced during the design cycle and enhancing the UX through multiple iterations without spending much time on documentation. 2010 technological advances allow high- fidelity SaaS (Software as a Service) prototyping without coding.


### Forms of Prototyping 

### Throwaway/Rapid Prototyping 

‘Throw-away’ or ‘Rapid’ prototyping pertains to developing a small part of a system, then giving it to the end user to try out and evaluate. The user provides feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system. The prototype is then discarded or thrown away. Rapid/Throwaway prototyping essentially helps to ascertain a complete set of user requirements.  

The advantages of utilising rapid prototyping relate to involving customers at an early stage of development as a complete set of customer requirements can be obtained through the feedback, thus also better meeting the final product's need. Though the disadvantages of rapid prototyping are that project management is ignored and poorly operating prototypes that don't meet quality assurance standards are delivered to consumers.  

### Evolutionary Prototyping 

The ideology behind Evolutionary Prototyping is that an initial prototype is drafted and presented to the user or consumers. Feedback is then provided regarding issues and suggestions for improvements. These are actioned by the developer/developers whom present a more refined prototype, with the user/consumer once more providing feedback. This process is then repeated, with the prototype ‘evolving’ at each stage, until a final system has been developed. Hence the term 'evolutionary prototyping'. 

### Incremental Prototyping 

Incremental Prototyping is a method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished. It involves both development and maintenance. 

### Extreme Prototyping 

Extreme Prototyping is an architectural process for developing applications(web-based), in terms of increasingly functional prototypes. This form of prototyping essentially breaks down web development into three distinct phases. The first phase is the static prototype, consisting of HTML pages and possibly a logical data model supporting those pages. The second phase is a coding process in your chosen web framework whereby the screens are fully functional using a simulated services layer. The third phase is where the services are implemented. 

### Characteristics of a prototype  

The characteristics of a Prototype can be found through investigating the overall differences between a finished product and a prototype and limitations.   For instance, prototypes are generally manufactured throughout the life cycle process, therefore certain material may not be accessible during the formulation and creation of a prototype, hence cheaper or quick alternatives (placeholders) are usually implemented instead.  This relates to all aspects of design including paper in addition to digital as flow charts are used to display functionality instead of code or images are used to display visual aesthetic and convey ideas instead of graphics or models. 

Furthermore, prototypes are generally seen as a pragmatic way of testing and removing defects with a product reducing the risk of a design not performing as intended. However, prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk, with practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the final product. 

Prototypes in addition to allowing key insights into design and issues with current builds are usually made in increments and of lower volume than the final product which would see mass production as the purpose and expectations of the final product are different than the prototype. Thus, the fabrication methods of a prototype are usually different in comparison to the final product as well. Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product. 

The costs of building the full design outright is also a deterrent and is time consuming especially when repeated numerous times (building the full design, figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them, then building another full design). As an alternative, rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes, which implement part, but not all, of the complete design. This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems, solve those problems, and then build the full design. 

Moreover, the final product may be subject quality assurance tests to verify conformance with set specifications. Prototypes however are generally made with individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product.
